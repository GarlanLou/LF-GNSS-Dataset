# LF-GNSS-Dataset

**LF-GNSS-Dataset: A Long-Duration and Complex Satellite Positioning Dataset for Urban Scenarios**

This dataset is specifically designed for challenging urban environments, featuring long-duration GNSS observations under complex conditions such as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and multipath effects. It aims to facilitate research and development in satellite positioning and integrated navigation systems.

The dataset is currently being organized and will be open-sourced immediately upon paper acceptance.
